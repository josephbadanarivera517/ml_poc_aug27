You can categorize sentiments into five levels based on a score from 0 to 10 as follows:

Very Negative (0-2): Sentiments that are extremely dissatisfied, angry, or critical.
Negative (3-4): Sentiments that are generally dissatisfied or express disappointment.
Neutral (5-6): Sentiments that are neither positive nor negative, or are mixed with no clear lean towards positivity or negativity.
Positive (7-8): Sentiments that express satisfaction, approval, or mild enthusiasm.
Very Positive (9-10): Sentiments that are extremely satisfied, enthusiastic, or appreciative.
This scale allows for a more granular analysis of sentiment, reflecting varying degrees of positivity and negativity.




Yes, categorizing reviews based on the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a common and effective approach. The NPS system itself uses a similar categorization:

Detractors (0-6): Customers who are unhappy and might discourage others from using the product or service.
Passives (7-8): Customers who are satisfied but unenthusiastic and could switch to a competitor.
Promoters (9-10): Customers who are highly satisfied and likely to recommend the product or service to others.
Using the five-level sentiment scale you mentioned (Very Negative to Very Positive) in conjunction with the NPS categorization is logical and can help in more detailed sentiment analysis. Here's how it aligns:

Very Negative (0-2): Detractors
Negative (3-4): Detractors
Neutral (5-6): Detractors
Positive (7-8): Passives
Very Positive (9-10): Promoters
